For even as the wars of the Horus Heresy tore the Imperium apart and set even the noblest of his brothers on dark paths, Sanguinius remained untarnished and resolute, a beacon of hope that outshone even the darkness of that age.\n\nSanguinius is sculpted in the midst of battle, wings spread as he swoops down to deliver a killing blow to an unseen enemy. The model is held aloft by a spire of stone, giving the illusion of flight. Sanguinius' ornately designed armour, and the animal pelt he wears draped over it, provide a variety of textures and designs sure to delight painters, while his face is a mix of majesty and fury that perfectly reflects the duality of the Blood Angels Legion. A choice of weapons – the Blade Encarmine and the Spear of Telesto – allow the model to be customised as you choose.\n\nSanguinius, Primarch of the Blood Angels, is supplied in 26 resin components, including a choice of two weapons and a 40mm gaming base.\n\nRules for using Sanguinius in your games of Warhammer: The Horus Heresy can be found in Liber Astartes – Loyalist Legiones Astartes Army Book. This miniature is supplied unpainted and requires assembly – we recommend using Citadel paints.\n\nThis resin modelling kit is not a toy – it is a collectible item and construction should only be undertaken by expert Warhammer hobbyists aged 15 years and over.",

As the Nurgling matures it feeds upon the filth of the Great Unclean One and pops out; the very personification of a boil or pustule. Their tiny teeth are as sharp as razors, leaving festering bites upon their victims, but rarely killing them outright – although such an attack can prove the beginning of a long, disease-ridden demise.\n\nThis kit contains – quite literally – stacks of Nurglings. In fact, with this kit you can make three tottering towers of them. Every swarm has front, back and middle ranks; each is comprised of wriggling little horned beasts that are saturated in sores, cuts, lumps and opened orifices. They also come in a variety of characterful poses - most of them sickening. Though you can actually make 27 combinations of Nurgling towers, there are loads of individual Nurglings for using on bases for the rest of your army.\n\nThis multi-part plastic boxed set contains 16 components with which to build 3 varying towers of Nurglings. Supplied with 3 Citadel 40mm Round bases.",

The Imperium teeters on the brink of annihilation, beset upon all sides by heretic warlords, daemon-summoning witches, and rapacious alien empires. The Great Rift sunders the void, a ragged wound torn through the heart of the Emperor's realm and bleeding madness and mutation across all.\n\nIn every star system and upon every planet, battle rages more fiercely than ever before as loyalists, heretics, and aliens tear reality itself apart in their war dominance. Every day the flames rise higher – this is a more terrible era than ever before, for there is no peace amongst the stars…\n\nThe Book\nThis 220-page hardback book is an essential guide to Warhammer 40,000, and contains everything you need to know to collect, build, paint, and play with Citadel miniatures in the grim darkness of the 41st Millennium.\n\nYou'll find an overview of the Warhammer 40,000 hobby in all its aspects, core rules for playing out battles that range from small skirmishes to massive Onslaught games, and an in-depth introduction to this rich and ruinous setting through immersive lore, stunning illustrations and photography, and an evocative look at each of the factions waging war in the far future.\n\nTHE WARHAMMER 40,000 HOBBY\nThe book opens with an introduction to this amazing hobby through its four keys – Collect, Build, Paint, and Play. You'll find out how to start your collection of Citadel miniatures, learn how people build and paint their models, and get suggestions to tools and guides that will help further. You'll also begin your journey as a commander with a look at how, where, and why players engage in dynamic tabletop battles of Warhammer 40,000, an example Battle Report between two armies, and an explanation of different styles of play – self-contained Combat Patrols, competitive Chapter Approved games, and narrative Crusade campaigns.\n\nDARK IMPERIUM\nThis expansive lore section provides a doorway into the grim darkness of the 41st Millennium. It is a far-distant future dominated by an oppressive and corrupt Human empire, its crumbling borders defended by doomed heroes and imperiled by threats from both without and within, its history marked by ignorance and carnage and the laughter of thirsting gods.\n\nThe first part of this guide explores the decaying Imperium and the galaxy in which it resides – the long-dead God-Emperor who sits eternal on his Golden Throne, the High Lords and Adeptus bureaucracies that rule in his name, the fanatical Ecclesiarchy which preaches the Imperial faith, the secretive Ordos of the all-seeing Inquisition, and the post-human Space Marines who fight battles no other could endure. You'll also discover the hellish dimension known as the warp, which fuels psychic mutation and interstellar travel, the mad Gods of Chaos who rule its infinite depths, the blasphemous cults that serve them, and the Great Rift that splits realspace itself in two.\n\nThere's also a double-page galactic map, highlighting vital planets, systems, war zones, and warp storms.\n\nThe second half delves into the history of the setting, from its myth-shrouded past to the apocalyptic clashes of its present. You'll find a timeline of Humanity's development through the Ages of Terra and Technology, the Ages of Strife and Darkness, all the way to the Age of the Imperium. You'll explore the superstitions that fuelled the Imperium's worship of lost technology and its fearful hatred of aliens and mutants, the Great Crusade through which the Emperor sought to unite Humanity, the Horus Heresy that set the galaxy aflame, and the millennia of war and loss that shaped the Imperium.\n\nFinally, you'll enter the Era Indomitus – marked by the opening of the Great Rift, the birth of a new God of Death, and the revival of the Primarch Roboute Guilliman. Even as the new Lord Regent's Indomitus Crusade strives to reunite the dying Imperium, a psychic awakening heralds a terrifying Age of Witches, and Abaddon the Despoiler plagues the galaxy with aid of the daemonic demigod Vashtorr and their Arks of Omen. The return of Lion El'Jonson, the First Primarch of the Emperor, only forestalls total disaster – and with the resurgence of Hive Fleet Leviathan, the galaxy may be reduced to nothing but food for an alien swarm.\n\nFACTIONS\nExplore each of the factions waging war in Warhammer 40,000, with detailed background information plus tactical descriptions and a miniature showcase of their Combat Patrols. The mustered Armies of the Imperium include mighty Space Marine Chapters, the ranks of the Astra Militarum, the fanatical cults of the Adeptus Mechanicus and Adepta Sororitas, and the golden guardians known as the Adeptus Custodes. The blasphemous Forces of Chaos feature ancient Traitor Legions and more recent Heretic Astartes, as well as the otherworldly Chaos Daemons. Finally, the insidious Xenos Threat ranges from the brutish Orks, mercenary Leagues of Votann, and expansionist T'au Empire to the ancient branches of Aeldari and Drukhari, the deathless Necrons, and the ravening Tyranids and their Genestealer Cults.\n\nCORE RULES\nThe Warhammer 40,000 Core Rules contain everything you need to know in order to wage glorious battle across the war-torn galaxy of the 41st Millennium. These basic rules are used for games of all sizes and styles, and provide a foundation for use with other supplements.\n\nYou'll learn the general principles and core concepts of Warhammer 40,000, the datasheets and characteristics used by your models, and the rules that apply to the five phases of the game: the Command phase, the Movement phase, the Shooting phase, the Charge phase, and the Fight phase. You'll also find Stratagems and abilities used by all armies, as well as additional rules for elements like Strategic Reserves, terrain features, and aircraft.\n\nLastly, there are rules for mustering an army, setting up your models for a game, controlling objectives to claim victory, and a mission – Only War – to get you started playing right away.\n\nCOMBAT PATROL\nCombat Patrol is the ideal starting point for playing Warhammer 40,000. Fast-paced and quick to learn, it uses the Core Rules to play out tactical clashes that should last up to one hour, using only the contents of Combat Patrol boxes. These forces each have bespoke, self-contained rules which are presented online and in other publications, and provide everything you need to get playing. This section provides an introduction to the Combat Patrol game mode, an explanation of the Battle Ready standard of painting for games, and six different Combat Patrol missions – Clash of Patrols, Archeotech Recovery, Forward Outpost, Scorched Earth, Sweeping Raid, and Display of Might – each with their own objectives, mission rules, and deployment maps for a variety of game experiences.\n\nThe book concludes with a separate index for the Core Rules, acting as a handy reference for use while playing games.",

The World Eaters long held a reputation for wanton savagery, and as they fell to the powers of Chaos, they devolved into warbands of blood-crazed maniacs dedicated to the Taker of Skulls, glorying in violence and slaughter, and with no other purpose than spilling blood in their deity's name.\n\nTake skulls for the Skull Throne with Combat Patrol: World Eaters! This boxed set provides you with all the units you need to start your army or expand an existing collection. The contents have been chosen to provide you with a ferocious core for any World Eaters force, ideal for Combat Patrol-sized games and will also save you money compared to buying the contents individually.\n\nThis set includes the following multipart plastic models:\n– 1x World Eaters Lord on Juggernaut, which can alternatively be built as Lord Invocatus\n– 10x Jakhals\n– 20x Khorne Berzerkers\n– 2x World Eaters Transfer Sheets, each containing 200 transfers\n\nAll models are supplied with their appropriate bases.

    "description": "Angron is the Red Angel, Lord of the World Eaters, the Daemon Primarch of Khorne. Raised as a slave in the brutal fighting pits of Nuceria, this maddened demigod sought glorious death in the battles of the Horus Heresy – only to be damned to an eternity of undying rage. For ten thousand years he has savaged the Imperium, fury given immortal form, the butchers of the XII Legion following in his bloody wake. When he steps forth into realspace, Angron is an unstoppable engine of destruction with the strength to tear apart bastions with his bare hands and stop Titans in their tracks. His very presence drives those around him into a frenzy of wrath and fear, as he carves his way through entire armies in a whirlwind of apocalyptic bloodshed.\n\nThis multipart kit builds Angron, Daemon Primarch of Khorne – the eternal master of the World Eaters Legion. This imposing warrior towers head and shoulders above most miniatures on the battlefield, including his own frenzied sons amongst the World Eaters. He's armed with his massive chainaxe, Spinegrinder, and the brutal rune-etched daemon sword known as Samni’arius – both weapons chained to his wrists in true Nucerian style. His warped form is festooned with grisly trophies and World Eaters iconography, with a barbed club-tail whipping behind him, shadowed by a pair of sinister spiked wings. Even his base is littered with skulls, as his hooved feet mount a broken rocky outcrop.\n\nAngron's monstrous visage can be built in a fanged roar or close-mouthed snarl, and he can be assembled with his infernal musculature laid bare, or clad in the twisted Armour of Mars – the same gladiatorial plate that he wore during the Horus Heresy, warped to match his daemonic form. However you build him, the powerful physique, dynamic pose, and sheer size of this fallen Primarch commands immediate attention, making him a truly impressive centrepiece in any World Eaters army and an absolute treat for painters and collectors of all stripes.\n\nThis kit comprises 77 plastic components, and is supplied with a Citadel 100mm Round Base.

Some have achieved such great feats of carnage that the Taker of Skulls has seen fit to reward them with a juggernaut – a savage daemonic steed with brazen skin and molten ichor, capable of crushing all in its path as the two charge into the fray.\n\nThis multipart plastic kit builds a World Eaters Lord on Juggernaut – a deadly killer mounted atop a brass-skinned daemon. This mighty warrior is clad in armour decorated with the symbols of Khorne, with a choice of two different shoulder pads for each arm, and can be built with one of two heads – an ornate crested helm, or a bare head wearing a snarling rebreather. The Lord wields an exalted chainblade in the form of either a vicious chainsword or long-handled chainaxe, and is also armed with a plasma pistol – he can be posed aiming the pistol at his enemies, or clinging to one of his mount's rings. His juggernaut steed is covered in biomechanical detail, and also offers two different head options – one with a sleek bladed crest, the other sporting a jagged horn.\n\nThis kit can alternatively build Lord Invocatus.\n\nThis kit comprises 66 plastic components, and is supplied with a Citadel 90x52mm Oval Base.

Wielding all manner of enormous chain weapons, a pack of Eightbound are capable of ripping apart almost anything that dares to stand against them.\n\nThis multipart plastic kit builds three Eightbound – shockingly potent demi-daemons fielded by the World Eaters. These monstrous warriors resemble warped, overgrown Khorne Berzerkers, from their exposed muscles and cybernetics to their ornate and twisted armour. Each Eightbound is armed with two eviscerators, massive chain weapons resembling chainswords or chainaxes. You can also build an Eightbound Champion, who can instead be armed with a pair of cleaver-like lacerators, or a two-handed heavy chainglaive.\n\nThe kit is loaded with interchangeable and cosmetic components, including alternate heads, different designs for chest plates, shoulder pads, and power packs, and the option to build your Eightbound with bare torsos. There's enough variety to make each Eightbound pack unique, and fill your bits box with extras.

Look upon them and see the signs: pus seeping from festering wounds that never heal; miasmic smogs of corrosive, stinking gas hanging thickly in the air wherever Nurgle’s chosen tread; the wriggling, lamprey-mouthed tick-leeches that clamp on to their rotting flesh; the droning billions of plague flies that swarm the battlefields they stalk and the ships in which they course through the stars.\n\nCombat Patrol is the smallest sized game, and this Death Guard force is a great way to start – regardless of whether you want to play an open play game, forge a narrative with a Crusade army, or compete in a matched play mission. If this is the beginning of your first-ever Death Guard army or you're looking at adding to an existing force, this box is ideal.\n\nThis 243-piece plastic kit makes the following models:\n\n– 1x Typhus\n– 1x Biologus Putrifier\n– 7x Plague Marines\n– 30x Pox Walkers\n\nIt is supplied with 30 25mm Citadel round bases, 7 32mm Citadel round bases, 1 40mm Citadel round base, and 1 50mm Citadel round base.",

    "name": "Mortarion, Daemon Primarch of Nurgle",
    "description": "For ten thousand years Mortarion, Lord of the Death Guard, has crushed his enemies upon the field of battle. Surrounded by chittering Daemon mites, droning flies and noxious plague vapours, Mortarion swoops into battle on vast, creaking wings. the thudding beat of these foul pinions fills the enemy with crawling dread, even as they waft the reek of death across their lines. To even stand in the presence of the Death Lord is lethal, opponents choking and collapsing as they succumb to the myriad plagues that churn the air around him.\n\nThis multi-part plastic kit contains the components necessary to assemble Mortarion, Daemon Primarch of Nurgle. This is a towering model – the word ‘miniature’ barely does it justice, as he looms over the rest of the Death Guard and gives even Bloodthirsters something to look up to! He is clad in baroque power armour known as the Barbaran Plate – this is covered in rust and rot, with skulls, spikes and Nurgle symbolism on each of the chunky components. Mouldering robes, chains and a rotten cowl hang from this armour, partially covering the system of pipes that feed his breathing apparatus – it is safe to assume that this ventilator isn’t delivering fresh and clean air to Mortarion, rather vile spores and disease.\n\nHe is armed with 2 foul weapons: a massive scythe named Silence, a rusting yet razor-sharp blade featuring brutal chain-teeth, stained with the blood of worlds and capable even of hacking a Reaver Titan to pieces; and The Lantern, an ancient energy pistol. There are two modelling options for these weapons – one option features the weapons down by Mortarion’s side, the other features a much more aggressive pose.\n\nMortarion features huge, decaying wings – these are modelled with pockmarks, holes and tears, representing the horror and decay of Nurgle’s hordes. Speaking of Nurgle’s hordes, there are plenty of extras with this kit – 2 Nurgling Drones carrying phosphex bombs hang from the chains on Mortarion’s armour, with a further 3 on the base: 1 carries a Chaos icon, one waves a censer and one carries a tank of unmentionably horrid substances. The base itself is detailed with rocks which themselves are being corrupted by the foul presence of the Daemon Primarch.\n\nMortarion, Daemon Primarch of Nurgle comes as 78 components, and is supplied with a Citadel 100mm Round base.",

They stalk forward with combi-bolters blazing, mercilessly mowing down rank after rank of the enemy. Plague spewers and blight launchers add to the fusilade, reducing infantry to slop and vehicles to foetid husks of rust and decomposing slag.\n\nThis multipart plastic kit contains the components necessary to assemble a unit of 5 Blightlord Terminators. They can be assembled with a fearsome array of wargear, and the kit includes the following weapon options:\n\n- 4 combi-bolters\n- 3 bubotic axes\n- 3 baleswords\n- 1 reaper autocannon\n- 1 plague spewer\n- 1 blight launcher\n- 1 flail of corruption\n- 1 combi-weapon (with a choice of combi-plasma, combi-flamer or combi-melta)\n\nThe Blightlord Terminators come as 64 components, and are supplied with 5 Citadel 40mm Round bases.",

Resembling a Bloat-drone that has been stripped of its turbines, this strange machine has heavy weapons mounted on its carapace, and its rusting armoured plates can absorb impressive punishment – as can its blubbery exposed flesh-parts, which soak up appalling trauma.\n\nThe Myphitic Blight-hauler is an unpleasant combination of machine and putrid rotting meat. From the front, it resembles some grotesque armoured vehicle, with a curved carapace featuring the symbol of Nurgle and 2 large, covered tracks. Where this differs from an ordinary attack vehicle, however, is the toothed maw at the bottom. From the rear, the horror continues – a third track is visible, along with a mass of flabby flesh, bound into the machine with straps and metal. The Myphitic Blight-hauler is armed with a multi-melta and missile launcher, which are mounted either side of the carapace.\n\nThis plastic kit comes as 13 components, and is supplied with a Citadel 80mm Round base.

Sworn to Nurgle’s service, Plague Marines have disgusting, rotted bodies that stink of decay. The putrescent slime that oozes from their sores corrodes armour boils away skin, yet despite their horrific disfigurements they are fearsome warriors indeed.\n\nThis multi-part plastic kit contains the components necessary to assemble a 7-man squad of Plague Marines. Each is posed dynamically, with the usual Death Guard accoutrements – cracked, rotting armour revealing grasping tentacles, severed heads displayed proudly on belts, backpacks sloshing with unnatural diseases and pipework leading from rebreathers to Nurgle knows what foul concoctions. There’s an Icon of Despair included, so your unit can feature an icon bearer.\n\nThese models feature a wide range of weapons and heads, many of which are designed to fit a specific model – there are 8 boltguns, 4 plague knives, 2 bubotic axes, a blight launcher, a plasma gun, a meltagun, a plaguebelcher, a heavy plaguespewer (with backpack), a mace of contagion, a great plague cleaver, a plague flail, a plasma pistol and a bolt pistol. There are 2 weapon options available for the unit Champion: a specific plaguesword and power fist, and there are a total of 16 bare and helmeted heads. 2 specific arms are included for a model holding a blight grenade, with one hand pulling the pin.\n\nThis kit comes as 146 components, and is supplied with 7 Citadel 32mm Round bases.",

From his ancient ship, the Terminus Est, Typhus spreads contagion and misery across the galaxy. That Typhus has been truly blessed by Nurgle is indisputable. For ten thousand years he has been a blight on Imperial worlds; in the wake of Typhus’ fleet a virulent plague spreads, creating plague zombies whose bites carry the disease to new victims. Billions have died and been returned to undeath, as the proliferating energies of Chaos distort and mutate this disease to ever-more terrifying vectors.\n\nThis multi-part plastic kit contains the components necessary to build Typhus, Herald of Nurgle, Host of the Destroyer Hive. This is an appropriately large model, covered head to toe in rot, pitted Cataphractii armour, skulls, Nurgle icons and spikes – there’s even room for a Nurgling to hitch a ride, clinging to his waist. He holds aloft a master-crafted manreaper, taller even than Typhus himself, which features a host of unpleasant effects of corruption and wear; it’s clearly a blade that has seen a lot of action. The chimney found on his back is belching forth a vile hive swarm with impressive effect – some of the flies bursting forth are the size of a Nurgling. Included is a scenic element to his base, as he stands with a foot resting arrogantly on some toppled Imperial masonry.\n\nThis kit comes as 15 components, and is supplied with a Citadel 50mm Round base.",

There are also exposed innards here and there, and in one of the creature’s bulbous abdomen are the horrific, contorted faces of some poor, partially digested foe. Each of the three Rot Flies is unique, varying in features such as Plague Proboscis, mandibles and stinger. The Plaguebearers also feature an array of disturbing gifts of Nurgle, from their boils, open sores to their exposed entrails. They come with various horns and gesture with bony fingers, and they hold skulls or crude blades.\n\nThis multi-part plastic kit contains 86 components with which to make three Plague Drones of Nurgle.",
